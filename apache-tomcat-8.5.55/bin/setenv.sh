# Control Script for the CATALINA Server
#
# For supported commands call "catalina.sh help" or see the usage section at
# the end of this file.
#
# Environment Variable Prerequisites
#
#   Do not set the variables in this script. Instead put them into a script
#   setenv.sh in CATALINA_BASE/bin to keep your customizations separate.
#
#   CATALINA_HOME   May point at your Catalina "build" directory.
#
#   CATALINA_BASE   (Optional) Base directory for resolving dynamic portions
#                   of a Catalina installation.  If not present, resolves to
#                   the same directory that CATALINA_HOME points to.
#
#   CATALINA_OUT    (Optional) Full path to a file where stdout and stderr
#                   will be redirected.
#                   Default is $CATALINA_BASE/logs/catalina.out
#
#   CATALINA_OPTS   (Optional) Java runtime options used when the "start",
#                   "run" or "debug" command is executed.
#                   Include here and not in JAVA_OPTS all options, that should
#                   only be used by Tomcat itself, not by the stop process,
#                   the version command etc.
#                   Examples are heap size, GC logging, JMX ports etc.
#
#   CATALINA_TMPDIR (Optional) Directory path location of temporary directory
#                   the JVM should use (java.io.tmpdir).  Defaults to
#                   $CATALINA_BASE/temp.
#
#   JAVA_HOME       Must point at your Java Development Kit installation.
#                   Required to run the with the "debug" argument.
#
#   JRE_HOME        Must point at your Java Runtime installation.
#                   Defaults to JAVA_HOME if empty. If JRE_HOME and JAVA_HOME
#                   are both set, JRE_HOME is used.
#
#   JAVA_OPTS       (Optional) Java runtime options used when any command
#                   is executed.
#                   Include here and not in CATALINA_OPTS all options, that
#                   should be used by Tomcat and also by the stop process,
#                   the version command etc.
#                   Most options should go into CATALINA_OPTS.
#
#   JAVA_ENDORSED_DIRS (Optional) Lists of of colon separated directories
#                   containing some jars in order to allow replacement of APIs
#                   created outside of the JCP (i.e. DOM and SAX from W3C).
#                   It can also be used to update the XML parser implementation.
#                   This is only supported for Java <= 8.
#                   Defaults to $CATALINA_HOME/endorsed.
#
#   JPDA_TRANSPORT  (Optional) JPDA transport used when the "jpda start"
#                   command is executed. The default is "dt_socket".
#
#   JPDA_ADDRESS    (Optional) Java runtime options used when the "jpda start"
#                   command is executed. The default is localhost:8000.
#
#   JPDA_SUSPEND    (Optional) Java runtime options used when the "jpda start"
#                   command is executed. Specifies whether JVM should suspend
#                   execution immediately after startup. Default is "n".
#
#   JPDA_OPTS       (Optional) Java runtime options used when the "jpda start"
#                   command is executed. If used, JPDA_TRANSPORT, JPDA_ADDRESS,
#                   and JPDA_SUSPEND are ignored. Thus, all required jpda
#                   options MUST be specified. The default is:
#
#                   -agentlib:jdwp=transport=$JPDA_TRANSPORT,
#                       address=$JPDA_ADDRESS,server=y,suspend=$JPDA_SUSPEND
#
#   JSSE_OPTS       (Optional) Java runtime options used to control the TLS
#                   implementation when JSSE is used. Default is:
#                   "-Djdk.tls.ephemeralDHKeySize=2048"
#
#   CATALINA_PID    (Optional) Path of the file which should contains the pid
#                   of the catalina startup java process, when start (fork) is

#
#   CATALINA_LOGGING_CONFIG (Optional) Override Tomcat's logging config file
#                   Example (all one line)

#
#   LOGGING_CONFIG  Deprecated
#                   Use CATALINA_LOGGING_CONFIG
#                   This is only used if CATALINA_LOGGING_CONFIG is not set
#                   and LOGGING_CONFIG starts with "-D..."
#
#   LOGGING_MANAGER (Optional) Override Tomcat's logging manager
#                   Example (all one line)
#                   LOGGING_MANAGER="-Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager"
#

#
#   USE_NOHUP       (Optional) If set to the string true the start command will
#                   use nohup so that the Tomcat process will ignore any hangup

#                   case the default is "true"
